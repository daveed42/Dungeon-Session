# Dungeon-Session
Interactive dungeon map creator for tabletop RPGs

Dungeon Session is an online tool that allows for the creation and sharing of dungeon maps for use in tabletop RPGs.  Sessions can be created when sharing so that a GM can slowly reveal parts of a map as the game progresses and players can move their characters on maps for better visualization of combat.  It is not meant to be a way to play the game online, but rather a way to supplement maps which can often be very tedious to make and take up quite a bit of space at a table.
